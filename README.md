# An example web app using face detection.

## This is an automatic squat counter.

- First allow camera access permission.
- Then show your face to your web camera.
- Wait until you see a red circle around your face.
- In case your face is not detected, try stepping back a little, or adjusting camera angle and the lighting.
- Now start squatting all the way down to the red horizontal line. (You can ajdust the position of horizontal lines by tapping buttons below the camera image.)
- The app will count up the number.
- When the circle changes its color to blue, slowly go up to the blue horizontal line.
- Great! That's one count of a squat.
- Now repeat the process and start excercising!
